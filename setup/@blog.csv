"Australia, the Lucky Country","In which the author explores what it means to be a lucky country, or at least to live in one.","I once knew a young lady who had decided to travel far and wide to explore the Lucky Country.¶¶Alas, no more, or perhaps, a lass no more, but in either case, her explorations are far from over, due for the most part to the fact that they had never begun.¶Let me explain. When she had arrived at her momentous decision to wander about, seemingly aimlessly, she remembered that she had forgotten something, which is pretty clever when you think of it. Then she forgot what she had remembered, and so was no longer aware that she had forgotten anything.¶¶Unfortunately, in the process she also forgot to explore the Lucky Country, which is pretty unlucky.","2023-11-19 14:33:01","2019-03-31 16:50:29",
"The Land Down Under","A simple doggerel about Down Under","The country, they say is Down Under.¶To some, it may look like a blunder.¶Why should it be so?¶Wherever you go,¶The label may cause you to wonder.¶¶To those who prefer not to wander,¶Who seldom go thither or yonder,¶Not wishing to roam¶Or stray from their home,¶It’s simply a matter to ponder.","2023-11-19 14:33:17","2019-03-30 10:54:19",
"The Sydney Opera House","Sydney’s most famous opera house is known as the Sydney Opera house — they decided not to call it the Copenhagen Opera House because that would have required moving to Denmark.","Many years ago, someone decided that something Sydney desperately needed was an opera house. The result was, well, the Sydney Opera House, which is a pretty catchy name, especially compare to alternatives such as “that funny shaped building in Sydney”, or “you know, the opera house thingy in Sydney”.¶¶Of course in Sydney, it’s just called the “Opera House”, because how many other opera houses would you expect to find in Sydney, or even want to find, given that it’s likely to house some opera.¶¶You can actually experience opera at the Opera House (Sydney, as well as other Opera Houses, presumably). Not as much as other performing arts such as concerts, ballet, or sight-seeing which is a very popular performing art.¶¶The Opera House (the Sydney one, that is not any other one) is situated at a location known as Bennelong Point, which was named after a local historical character, and not for the time it took to build the Opera House which, as you might say, has bennelong time.","2023-11-12 13:59:30","2023-11-12 13:59:30",opera-house.jpg
"Some Australian Terms","Australians speak a dialect distantly related to English. Here you will see some terms which may help you to communicate.","G’Day: Hello¶Seeyalata: Goodbye¶Bloody Oath: My word, yes¶Cupplapies: Lunch","2019-03-29 20:24:33","2019-03-30 10:49:42",
"The Brighton Bathing Boxes"," … , or the Bathing Boxes of Brighton.¶¶At Melbourne’s Brighton Beach, you’ll find some boxes. They’re not just any boxes — they’re the famous Brighton Bathing Boxes, so-called because they’re Bathing Boxes at Brighton Beach.","At Melbourne’s Brighton Beach, you’ll find some boxes. They’re not just any boxes — they’re the famous Brighton Bathing Boxes, so-called because they’re Bathing Boxes at Brighton Beach.You would have thought that the whole point of of going to the beach has something to do with exposing yourself to the outside. However, there’s such a thing as too much exposure.¶¶The Brighton Bathing Boxes were built in the early 19th century, to allow ladies to maintain their modesty while changing to the sort of attire a lady would be expected to wear at the beach from the sort of attire a lady would be expected to wear anywhere else.¶¶The ladies have since moved on, but the boxes, being boxes, haven’t. Instead they have continued to adorn the beach with new colours and new owners. Possibly new sand as well, as it’s hard to keep track of sand.","2023-11-15 15:24:29","2023-11-15 15:24:29",bathing-boxes.jpg
"Hanging Rock","Once, there was a picnic.","And then lots of other stuff. Well, not lots, actually. In fact nothing happened at all all.¶¶Except that a few children went missing. In fact they didn’t, but it makes a better story.","2023-11-19 08:20:43","2023-11-19 08:20:43",hanging-rock.jpg
"Steps and More Steps","Steps can lead to anywhere — or nowhere.","These steps go in both directions, both up and down. You might say that they’re bidirectional, but that depends partly on whether you’d want to.¶¶In one sense, you could say that they’re going nowhere. In another, more accurate sense, you could say they’re not.","2023-11-19 08:24:50","2023-11-19 08:24:50",steps.jpg
"This is a Platypus","This is not a fake, though you might be tempted to think so.","This creature is not in any way related to a cat, despite the fact that its name ends in “pus”. That single “s” on the end is the giveaway, though it’s really not giving much away, when you think of it.¶¶Needless to say, it’s also not in any way related to a platyhelminth, which is probably a good thing.","2023-11-19 14:15:34","2023-11-29 13:49:18",
