### A Little Bush Hut

There’s a track winding back to an old fashioned shack, but it’s not on the road to Gundagai. Or any other road, for that matter, because it’s in the bush and the track is about all you’re likely to get in place of a road.

The misquote is from a song from the 1920s, and you can learn a little more from this [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along_the_Road_to_Gundagai).

### Features

This little bush hut boasts the following features:

- It’s little. Good if you don’t like it to be _too big_.
- It’s in the bush. Which is to say it’s not in the city or in some other _non bush_ location.
- It’s a hut, so if you’re looking for a swimming pool or a set of saucepans this isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a _hut_, however, this might do the job.

### How to get there

If you want to see the hut:

1. _Don’t_ go along the road to Gundagai, because it isn’t there. Well, the road to Gundagai is there, but it’s somewhere else.
3. Find another track. Preferably the one with this little bush hut.
2. Follow the track to the hut.
4. There no step 4. If you get this far then this is as far as it gets.

That’s it, really.
